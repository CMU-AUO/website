<p>Hi <span class="caps">AUO</span>,</p>
<p>Every semester we have a competition where students submit t-shirt designs themed around our semester&#8217;s repertoire. The winner of the competition gets a free t-shirt. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Concert theme: Dramatic Soundscapes</p>
<p>Our Repertoire:<br />
Richard Wagner &#8212; Overture from the &#8220;Flying Dutchman&#8221;<br />
Gaetano Donizetti &#8212; &#8220;Quel guardo il cavaliere&#8230;&#8221; (from the opera Don Pasquale)<br />
Gabrielle Fauré &#8212; Prélude from “Pelleas et Melisande”<br />
Pyotr Tchaikovsky &#8212; Symphony No. 5 in E minor</p>
<p>Competition submission deadline: email me the designs by Sunday, October 19 at noon.</p>
<p>T-shirt designs should be made with one color (black is fine) and without shading.</p>
<p>It is encouraged that the T-shirt will have listed the date of the concert (November 23), repertoire, and the concert theme. It is ultimately up to you if/how you&#8217;d like to incorporate your design with with concert information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</p>
