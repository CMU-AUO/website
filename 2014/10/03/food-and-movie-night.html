<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>As we get rolling through this semester, it&#8217;s time for another social event!</p>
<p>This weekend, the <span class="caps">AUO</span> will be watching Halloween movies in Doherty! What better way to start off October than with pumpkin flavored baked goods, popcorn, and movies?</p>
<p>Some selections for movies include The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, Young Frankenstein, and whatever else you guys would like to bring. Let us know if you have a movie that you really want to watch!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be meeting in Doherty Hall A302 at 5:30 pm this Saturday. In order to make sure we have a diverse range of food, we&#8217;re going to make this kind of like a potluck, so that means you can bring some food and eat a whole bunch of different creations!</p>
<p>So, now that you know all the details, you all should definitely come! It&#8217;s going to be a great way to bond with your fellow orchestra members, share food and stories, and watch super awesome movies.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a great week and that I will see you on Saturday!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Alex Cerny<br />
