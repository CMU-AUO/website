<p>This past week, members of the All University Orchestra raised money during their biannual Bake Sale. Headed by <span class="caps">AUO</span> Board Member, Albina Kwak, members sold baked goods over a two-day period. If you missed out, do not worry, there will be another bake sale to support our organization during the spring semester. (Pictured: Elon)</p>
