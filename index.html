            The Carnegie Mellon All-University Orchestra is an ensemble composed of CMU undergrads,
            graduate students, staff, and faculty who love to make music. There are no auditions or
            try-outs - everyone is welcome!
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" >
            The AUO puts on one concert per semester, available free of charge to members of the CMU
            community and the public. See our Concerts Page for this year's schedule and recordings of
            some of our past concerts.

            AUO String Theory is a companion ensemble to AUO's main orchestra. Founded in 2008 as a
            string ensemble, AUO String Theory is now a small chamber orchestra, giving regular
            independent concerts. AUO String Theory aims to present a wide range of repertoire at a
            high musical standard, and give students the experience of playing in a smaller
            ensemble.
