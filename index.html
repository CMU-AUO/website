	    <p>The All University Orchestra extends an invitation for you to join them during their 18th season featuring rousing music from composers both old and new. Our fall program includes an exciting contrast of repertoire, beginning with Hector Berlioz’s exciting overture <em>Carnival Romain</em>, conducted by assistant Joel Goodloe; and followed by Antonin Dvorak’s lyrical <em>Violin Concerto in A minor Op. 53</em>, featuring New World Symphony fellow, Michael McCarthy. The second half brings our imagination at full attention with Ottorino Respighi’s masterpiece, <em>Pini di Roma</em>. The concert is November 22nd in Carnegie Music Hall – Oakland.</p>

Also on the program will be Igor Stravinsky’s famous <em>Firebird Suite (1919)</em>, which helped bring the composer to international prominence. The concert is April 3rd in Carnegie Music Hall – Oakland.</p>

<p>Miami-based New World Symphony violinist Michael McCarthy, will performing Antonin Dvorak’s Violin Concerto in A minor with the All University Orchestra on their fall program, November 22nd at Carnegie Music Hall.</p>

<p>A native of Liberty Borough, Pennsylvania, Michael began his violin studies at the age of three as a student of Joseph Petron in the Suzuki program at Duquesne University. As a young student, Michael was selected as a winner of the Duquesne Young Artists’ Competition in 2000 and 2002, and received the Hilda Willis Performing Arts Scholarship to attend the Winchester Thurston School as he began high school in 2004. During these years, Michael was a member of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra, took part in several PMEA Orchestra Festivals, and performed in side-by-side concerts with both the McKeesport and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestras. Michael was recognized for his musicianship as a recipient of the National School Orchestra Award in 2005 and 2008, as well as the Pittsburgh Tribune Review’s Young Achiever’s Award in 2006, and Outstanding Young Artist’s Award in 2008. In addition to being an avid orchestral musician, Michael also enjoyed success as a soloist in his high school years. In 2007, Michael was selected to perform Tchaikovsky&#39;s Violin Concerto in a master class with world-renowned violinist Ilya Gringolts. He was also selected as a winner of the Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra Young Artists’ Competition in 2007, and the McKeesport Symphony Orchestra Young Artists’ Competition in 2008. </p>

	    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>As we get rolling through this semester, it&#8217;s time for another social event!</p>
<p>This weekend, the <span class="caps">AUO</span> will be watching Halloween movies in Doherty! What better way to start off October than with pumpkin flavored baked goods, popcorn, and movies?</p>
<p>Some selections for movies include The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, Young Frankenstein, and whatever else you guys would like to bring. Let us know if you have a movie that you really want to watch!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be meeting in Doherty Hall A302 at 5:30 pm this Saturday. In order to make sure we have a diverse range of food, we&#8217;re going to make this kind of like a potluck, so that means you can bring some food and eat a whole bunch of different creations!</p>
<p>So, now that you know all the details, you all should definitely come! It&#8217;s going to be a great way to bond with your fellow orchestra members, share food and stories, and watch super awesome movies.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a great week and that I will see you on Saturday!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
