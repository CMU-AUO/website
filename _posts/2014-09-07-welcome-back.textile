Hi, everybody!

I hope you all had amazing summers filled with interesting adventures. Now that school is back is session, we're going to start up rehearsals again!

The first rehearsal of the year is this Sunday, September 7 at the usual time and usual place -- CUC Connan at 7:30. We have another cool program lined up for this semester, including a piece featuring our concerto competition winner Joanna Latini. Also, there will be lots of prospective new members for you to meet!

See you on Sunday!
