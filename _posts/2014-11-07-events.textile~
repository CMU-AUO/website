AUO FUNDRAISING UPDATES

This past week, members of the All University Orchestra raised money during their biannual Bake Sale. Headed by AUO Board Member, Albina Kwak, members sold baked goods over a two-day period. If you missed out, do not worry, there will be another bake sale to support our organization during the spring semester. (Pictured: Elon)
