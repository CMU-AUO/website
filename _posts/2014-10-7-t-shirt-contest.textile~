Hi AUO,

Every semester we have a competition where students submit t-shirt designs themed around our semester's repertoire. The winner of the competition gets a free t-shirt. Here's what you need to know:

Concert theme: Dramatic Soundscapes

Our Repertoire:
Richard Wagner -- Overture from the "Flying Dutchman"
Gaetano Donizetti -- "Quel guardo il cavaliere..." (from the opera Don Pasquale)
Gabrielle Fauré -- Prélude from “Pelleas et Melisande”
Pyotr Tchaikovsky -- Symphony No. 5 in E minor

Competition submission deadline: email me the designs by Sunday, October 19 at noon.

T-shirt designs should be made with one color (black is fine) and without shading.

It is encouraged that the T-shirt will have listed the date of the concert (November 23), repertoire, and the concert theme. It is ultimately up to you if/how you'd like to incorporate your design with with concert information.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Mark
AUO VP
