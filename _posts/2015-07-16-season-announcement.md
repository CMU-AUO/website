The All University Orchestra extends an invitation for you to join them during their 18th season featuring rousing music from composers both old and new. Our fall program includes an exciting contrast of repertoire, beginning with Hector Berlioz’s exciting overture *Carnival Romain*, conducted by assistant Joel Goodloe; and followed by Antonin Dvorak’s lyrical *Violin Concerto in A minor Op. 53*, featuring New World Symphony fellow, Michael McCarthy. The second half brings our imagination at full attention with Ottorino Respighi’s masterpiece, *Pini di Roma*. The concert is November 22nd in Carnegie Music Hall – Oakland.

Our spring program leaps from the grand and lyrical toward the rhythmic, featuring music inspired by dance. Such pieces will include Arturo Márquez's *Danzón No. 2*, a style that originated in Cuba and grew popular in Mexico. Also on the program will be Igor Stravinsky’s famous *Firebird Suite (1919)*, which helped bring the composer to international prominence. The concert is April 3rd in Carnegie Music Hall – Oakland.
