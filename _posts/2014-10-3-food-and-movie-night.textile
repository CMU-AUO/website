title: AUO Food and Movie Night!
---
Hello Everyone!

As we get rolling through this semester, it's time for another social event!

This weekend, the AUO will be watching Halloween movies in Doherty! What better way to start off October than with pumpkin flavored baked goods, popcorn, and movies?

Some selections for movies include The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, Young Frankenstein, and whatever else you guys would like to bring. Let us know if you have a movie that you really want to watch!

We'll be meeting in Doherty Hall A302 at 5:30 pm this Saturday. In order to make sure we have a diverse range of food, we're going to make this kind of like a potluck, so that means you can bring some food and eat a whole bunch of different creations!

So, now that you know all the details, you all should definitely come! It's going to be a great way to bond with your fellow orchestra members, share food and stories, and watch super awesome movies.

I hope you all have a great week and that I will see you on Saturday!

Best wishes, 

Alex Cerny
AUO Secretary
