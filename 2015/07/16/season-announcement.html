<p>The All University Orchestra extends an invitation for you to join them during their 18th season featuring rousing music from composers both old and new. Our fall program includes an exciting contrast of repertoire, beginning with Hector Berlioz’s exciting overture <em>Carnival Romain</em>, conducted by assistant Joel Goodloe; and followed by Antonin Dvorak’s lyrical <em>Violin Concerto in A minor Op. 53</em>, featuring New World Symphony fellow, Michael McCarthy. The second half brings our imagination at full attention with Ottorino Respighi’s masterpiece, <em>Pini di Roma</em>. The concert is November 22nd in Carnegie Music Hall – Oakland.</p>
