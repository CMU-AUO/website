      <p>Dear Returning and Interested Members:</p>

      <p>Welcome back! I am very excited to begin rehearsals in a couple of weeks!<p/>

      <p>We will be holding Informal Auditions (cannot stress that enough) on Thursday, September 8th and Friday, September 9th from 6:00-10:30pm in MM127. These auditions are for part assignments only, and EVERYONE is still welcome to join!<p/>

      <p>If either of these dates do not work or all of the audition time slots have been filled, please email me for an alternate time. Please Sign-up for only ONE time and do not sign-up for a time someone else has taken.<p/>

      <p>Make sure to arrive warmed up and no later than 5 minutes before your audition time so we stay on track.<p/>

      <p>Click <a href=http://doodle.com/poll/np8ctphxe39zukxi>here</a> to Sign up for an Audition Time.<p/>

      <p>Looking forward to making music with you all once again.</p>

      <p>Sincerely,<br/>
