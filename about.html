If you are in more than one of our ensembles, you only need to pay your due once. We are funded by the Department of Student Activities, but also pursue fundraising opportunities.
  </p>

  <h5 class="text-left">Where does the AUO perform?</h5>
  <p>
  <i>AUO Symphony</i><br/>
  The AUO symphony is fortunate to perform our concerts in the historic Carnegie Music Hall, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Auditorium.

  <i>String Theory and Flutonium</i><br/>
  These chamber ensembles perform both on and off-campus. In the past we have performed in Carnegie Music Hall, Schenley Plaza and Kresge Theater.
  </p>

  <h5 class="text-left">Do I have to audition to be a part of the AUO organization?</h5>
  <p>
  The only audition required is for AUO Symphony members. You do not need to audition to participate in String Theory or Flutonium.
  </p>

  <h5 class="text-left">How do I audition for the AUO Symphony?</h5>
  <p>
  Students interested in the AUO Symphony will audition by sending a video link to AUO Music Director, Jeffrey Klefstad,  <a href="mailto:cmuauo@gmail.com">cmuauo@gmail.com</a>. Audition materials are located under the AUO Symphony Audition tab.
