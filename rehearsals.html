    AUO Meets every Sunday from 7:30pm to 10:00pm, usually in the UC Connan room. Our dress rehearsals, 
    and some regular rehearsals, are in the College of Fine Arts building's Alumni Concert Hall. Most 
    weeks also include a sectional, which meets from 6:30-7:15 in the same place. See the schedule below 
    for more information.
